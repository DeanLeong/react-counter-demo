# React Counter

Build out a Counter __class-based__ component, which should:
- store a state called count
- render the above state in the `render()` method
- have two methods, `increment` and `decrement` which should increment or decrement the count in state by one
- render a button to call each of these functions `onClick`

If you're hungry for more:
- create a `+1000000` button, as well as a corresponding `makeMillionaire` method, which should increment the counter by one million
- conditionally render the number as black if it is 0, green if it is above 0, and red if it is below 0.
